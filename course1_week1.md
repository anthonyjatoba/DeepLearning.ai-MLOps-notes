# Week 1: Overview of the ML Lifecycle and DeploymentThe 

## Machine Learning Project Lifecycle

### Steps of an ML Project

### Case study: speech recognition

## Deployment

### Key challenges

### Deployment patterns

### Monitoring

### Pipeline monitoring

Many AI systems are not just a single machine learning model running a prediction service, but instead involves a  pipeline of multiple steps. Changes on one step may affect the next steps.

Metrics to monitor:
* Software metrics
* Input metrics
* Output metrics

**How quickly data change?** some applications have data that changes quickly. User data generally has a slower drift. Enterprise data (B2B) can shift fast.
